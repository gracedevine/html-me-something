        <h1>My Favorite Foods</h1>
        <h2>Food is amazing. It nourishes our bodies, gives us energy, and connects people together. First dates are often at restaurants.
        Celebrations are centered around food such as delicious barbecues on the Forth of July, and
    decadent cakes on a birthdays. Food can remind of times in our past and the relationships that have grown over shared meals. Here are some of my
    favorites.</h2>

    <p>A plate of sauerkraut and potato pirogies brings special memories of holidays
at my grandparents house. My great-grand parents came here from the Ukraine and
brought with them recipes from their home country. Each and every holiday,my grandmother would put on her apron and would begin to cook.
Plates of pirogies, fried to perfection, smothered in caramelized onions, and covered
in sour cream, were served with love to my family. Today, I cannot look at pirogies without feeling
nostalgic for my childhood, and the cosy holidays in my grandmas tiny kitchen surrounded by my
loved ones.</p>

    <p>Ice cream is all things wonderful served on a cone. Is it any wonder that children line up
    for ice cream after little league games, or that the broken hearted eat it by the pint?.Ice cream
is a food that makes me smile after a hard day. It is food that makes reminds me of summers at Burt Lake in Michigan,
my teenagers as children with chocolate covered faces, and my father sitting with me on the porch of my childhood home.</p>

    <h1><a name="Pizza"></a></h1>
        <img src="images/pizzas-99663-1.jpg" alt="pizza">
    <p>Pizza is woven into so many of my memories. My family was far from rich. I grew up in the suburbs of Detroit, Mi. My father
    worked at a factory and sometimes money was tight. We had a wonderful pizzeria at the corner of my street. It was called Amicos.
    No matter what, the owners would make sure we had pizza. My sister and I would bundle up in the winter and walk to go pick it up. We
    would bicker over who would get to hold the warm box on the way home. As an adult, my husband and I lived in Italy for close to
    six years. My children were young and I consider this one of the most peaceful, happy times in my life. Every week we would go to
    an italian pizzeria and try new creations. Pizza with french fries on top, tuna, ridicchio, and many types of cheese. Pizza is my favorite
    food because it reminds me of a safe and secure home.</p>

    <h1><a name="Pad Thai"></a></h1>
        <img src="images/thai-food-518035_640.jpg"" alt="Pad thai">
    <p>Pad Thai is hot- spicy hot. So, of course, it reminds me of love. When I first joined the Air Force, I deployed to Thailand. I had just
    started dating an Airman named, Sean. Luckily, he got assigned to the same deployment. This was a time in my life where I was young and carefree. Over
    plates of Pad Thai, I began to fall in love with Sean. Many years later when my, now, husband, Sean and I need to reconnect, we go out for Pad Thai,
    and I am instantly reminded of our love story.</p>

    <h1><a name="Nachos"></a></h1>
        <img src="images/nachos-795612_640.jpg" alt="Plate of Nachos">
    <p>One Christmas I was tired. My children were toddlers. I had started college, and I was not feeling up to creating
    a traditional christmas meal. I went to the grocery store and saw green and red tortilla chips. I could hardly contain my joy. I
    realized that I was not doing right by Ukrainian heritage but desperate times call for desperate measures! I filled my basket with
    enough nacho supplies to feed an army and, with that one simple decision, a family tradition was born. Every year since my family has
    Christmas nachos. Every year my children ask me if I have bought the nacho supplies, and I smile, knowing that although the nachos seem
        important, it really is the memories we have enjoying them as a family that makes them special.</p>

    <h1><a name="Coffee"></a></h1>
        <img src="images/cappucino-95895-2.jpg" alt="coffee">
    <p>Technically coffee isn't a food, but any thing that can give me a pic-me-up and can taste like liquid heaven deserves a mention.Everything
    about coffee is wonderful: my cold hands around a warm mug, the cream and sugar that I know I shouldn't but can't help putting into my cup,
    and the quaint coffee shops where it is served. I have laughed tears of joy and spilled tears of sorrow into my mugs of coffee. On mothers
    day, all I want is my children to bring me a mug of coffee, no breakfast needed. Sometimes the most little things, the things that are taken
    for granted, are the things that bring the most joy. Coffee is that for me.</p>
